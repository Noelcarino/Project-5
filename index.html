                <h1>
                    Hello World!
                </h1>
                <p>March 27, 2019 / 2:44pm marks the day I start my portfolio. I am excited to see how much my portfolio grows. Today is day 1.</p>

                <p>I woke up at 10:50sh in my girlfriend's bed then went straight to starbucks next to San Gabriel Badminton Club #1. I have been here since 12:15sh and have not eaten breakfast. The Indonesian Fried rice I bought with my girlfriend last night was warmed up before I left and has been sitting in the car since I arrived at Starbucks. I can't wait to eat it, but I've been so eager to finish my projects in order to start my portfolio and recieved my First certificate as a web developer. </p>
